\chapter{Details Concerning Consistent Linearization of 2D Mortar Contact} % (fold)
\label{cha:details_concerning_consistent_linearization_of_2d_mortar_contact}
The computation of directional derivatives demands significant implementational effort associated with the proposed mortar finite element methods. Furthermore, they are necessary to guarantee the quadratic order of convergence of the Newton method on which the solution process is based. Due to that, details on the consistent linearizations are briefly provided in this appendix closely following \citet{popp2009}, \citet{popp2012} and \citet{farah2012}. Since this thesis restricts to the two-dimensional case, this appendix also restricts to the linearization of 2D mortar contact.
