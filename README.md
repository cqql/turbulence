# Turbulent Flow Simulation

## Setup

For development you should install the following tools

* `clang`: We use `clang`s `clang-format` to keep our coding style consistent.

You can use the script in `scripts/format` to automatically reformat all source
files. Alternatively try one of the integrations of `clang-format` into various
editors/IDEs.
